            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I’m an aspiring IT specialist and web developer with a multidisciplinary background that bridges technology, language, and human-centered problem-solving. With hands-on experience in JavaScript, Java, Python, and modern web technologies, I enjoy building clean, intuitive, and responsive applications—from everyday productivity tools to more specialized digital solutions.</p>
            <p>My journey combines a strong academic foundation with practical development experience. I hold an MSc in Digital Humanities from Riga Technical University, where I explored the intersection of technology and human culture, alongside an MA in Linguistics (University of Kelaniya) and a BA in English (University of Colombo). This blend of technical and linguistic expertise gives me a unique perspective on usability, communication, and the user experience.</p>
            <p>I’ve developed projects such as a Homework App and Calorie Calculator App, and honed my technical skills through programs like the Accenture Bootcamp, as well as certifications in JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures, Responsive Web Design, and Git.</p>
            <p>I am particularly motivated by opportunities to learn, build, and grow within the IT field. Whether collaborating on a development team or contributing to user-focused digital projects, I aim to create solutions that are both functional and meaningful.</p>
            <p>If you share similar interests in web development, digital humanities, or tech-driven creativity, I’d be happy to connect.</p>
